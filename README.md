# Arrays Recap

`Revisiting Java`

`In "Revisiting-Java", I continue to practice and strengthen my core java skills. Beginning with the Java Fundamentals and then later with Object Oriented Programming.`

Purpose: A small series of apps to practice the concepts in Section 5: Arrays

- Arrays
- Looping Arrays
- Updating Arrays
- 2D Arrays



<b>Exams</b>

Accessing elements using its index

<b>Exams2</b>

This time, I use a  for loop that runs through each element in the array and prints the array at its respective index

<b>Grocer</b>

Practicing if-else skills with loops: Using for loop to check every element in the array. If there’s a match, loop breaks and prints the index

<b>GrocerTwo</b>

Identical to Grocer but added Interactivity

<b>HighScore</b>

An array that stores a leaderboard of Pac Man scores. I loops through the array and check for the highest score. Whoever has the highest score wins and gets a prize

<b>HighScoreTwo</b>

Same as HighScore, but here I locate the person with highest score and print out the position in the array as their seat number

<b>Lottery Tickets</b>

Using Arrays.copyOf() to copy all the elements of of an array into another variable while also changing values.

<b>Pizza Delivery</b>

Simple app that asks user how many toppings they want and what toppings they want before dispatching a driver. Practicing  using for loops and storing user input values in arrays. 

<b>Prices</b>

Storing prices in a 2D Array the “long” way, then using the “faster way” using nested for loops

<b>RandomNumbers</b>

Generated 1000 random numbers and stored them in a 2DArray

<b>Receipt</b>

Simple practice exercise of a program that prints a receipt. 

<b>Ring Announcer</b>

Simple exercise where Java is a boxer. An array stores Java's boxing record. Using a for loop, I:
* count Java's wins and store the result in a variable: wins.
* count Java's losses and store the result in a variable: losses.
* Then give Java the boxer an introduction into the ring!

<b>Tax</b>

Simple program that updates price after taxes. No interactivity

<b>Weather</b>

Small program that prints hard coded temperatures in both celsius and fahrenheit.
